## Research Overview

My research focuses on developing innovative solutions in computer vision, event-based sensing, and network security. I am particularly interested in creating practical applications that can have real-world impact in areas such as mental health diagnosis and cybersecurity.

## Research Areas

### Computer Vision & Event-based Sensing
My work in this area involves developing high-frequency eye tracking systems using event cameras. Event cameras offer advantages over traditional frame-based cameras by providing microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, making them ideal for tracking rapid eye movements.

**Key Contributions:**
- Deep learning-based pupil region extraction from event camera data
- Novel hybrid frame-event approach for eye tracking
- Achievement of 38.4KHz tracking frequency
- Applications in mental health diagnosis

### Network Security & Programmable Switches  
I work on developing real-time anomaly detection systems using programmable network switches, specifically Intel Tofino2. This research aims to detect zero-day attacks and network anomalies at line speed.

**Key Contributions:**
- Performance evaluation of machine learning algorithms (BNN, iForest) on Tofino2
- Real-time feature extraction for network traffic analysis
- Enhanced clustering algorithms for anomaly detection
- Zero-day attack detection methodologies
